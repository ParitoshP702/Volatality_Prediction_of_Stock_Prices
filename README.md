# Volatality_Prediction_of_Stock_Prices
In this project, we try to predict the volatality of stocks of Standard and Poor's 500 stocks considered during the period of 2010-01-01 to 2022-01-01.
We first predict the stock prices using the conventional statistical models like the ARCH,GARCH,GJR-GARCH AND EGARCH models.
Then we use Machine Learning to predict the volatality of stocks by combining the SVM(Support Vector Machine) algorithm with the traditional GARCH model,namely the SVR-GARCH model.
We also use deep learning to predict the volatality of the same datset.
We use Bayesian technique of Metropolis Hastings to model our volatality.
Finally, we compare our various models with each other by evaluating the RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error) of each model.
